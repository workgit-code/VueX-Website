     1.1 About Vue <br>
     
     Vue Cinemas BV (Vue) is part of Vue International, the largest cinema group outside the United States and one of the major players in the big screen entertainment market. Vue has 21 cinemas in 20 cities in the Netherlands. Vue's mission is to deliver the best choice of content combined with the best technology in the best environment.
     <br>
     1.2 Data protection principles <br>
     
     This privacy statement applies to the use of personal data in relation to our website www.vuecinemas.nl, the Vue App and in our cinemas. In order to use these services and products, we need some information from you. Vue handles personal data with care because your privacy is important to us. Your personal data will only be processed if this is necessary to achieve the purposes as described in this privacy statement. We want to be as transparent and clear as possible about how Vue handles your data. That is why we show in this privacy statement what we use your data for and what rights you have.
     <br>
     1.3 Contact details Vue
     <br>
     Responsible for the use of your personal data is Vue Cinemas BV (Vue) with address Danzigerkade 2D, 1013 AP Amsterdam. If you have any questions or comments, please contact us at this address or at avghelpdesk@vuecinemas.nl.
     <br>
     1.4 Disclaimer text changes
     <br>
     The text of this privacy statement is subject to change. This version was last revised on 25-11-2019. To stay informed of our activities, we advise you to regularly consult this privacy statement.
     <br>
     2 What does Vue do with your personal data?
     <br>
     2.1 At the cinema
     <br>
     2.1.1 Tickets, admission, food and drinks
     <br>
     You can buy a movie ticket at the box office at our cinemas and get something delicious for during the movie. Sometimes we ask you to show proof of identity. We must check this in connection with: * the viewing guide for films for 16 years and older; * ordering alcohol at the bar. A minimum legal age of 18 applies here; * granting certain discounts, such as with a CJP pass, 65+ and a student pass; * using a Vue Movie Pass to access a movie. We check this because we have a legal obligation to do so, to check whether you are entitled to a discount ticket or to check that you are the actual holder of the Movie Pass shown. A copy of the proof of identity is never made. If you pay for a purchase with a debit or credit card, we only store data that cannot be traced back to you. This information is used to process the payment.
     <br>
     2.1.2 Cameras and incidental recordings
     <br>
     There are security cameras in our cinemas to ensure the safety of our staff and to prevent fraud and theft. We keep these images for a maximum of 4 weeks. In the event of incidents, we release the images to the Police and Justice.
     <br>
     During events and premieres, it is possible that camera crews from Vue or third parties make recordings. As a visitor to a cinema, you may be able to appear or be approached for an interview. We use the recordings for promotion and marketing purposes.
     <br>
     2.2 Online (website and app)   
     <br>
     Our website www.vuecinemas.nl and the Vue App are facilitated on behalf of Vue by an external website/app developer. All data from the website is stored with an external server provider.
     <br>
     2.2.1 Cookies
    <br>
     A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer, tablet or smartphone during your visit to a website. Information is stored in this text file. Some cookies are necessary for the website to function. These are the functional cookies. There are also cookies that are used to analyze and improve the quality of the website. These are analytical cookies. In addition, there are cookies that are useful for you because they recognize you when you visit the website again and they remember, for example, preferences (preferred cinema) so that you do not have to indicate it again and again. These cookies contribute to an increased user convenience for you as a visitor. See our cookie statement for more information about the cookies that can be placed via our website.
     <br>
     2.2.2 E-Ticket
     <br>
     You can buy an e-ticket for the film online. You can do this in two different ways. By means of a registration, this can be done via Facebook or after registering an e-mail address and password. Or by creating a guest account. For a guest account, only an email address is required to be able to email the e-ticket. Please note, without a MyVue account you can no longer view your e-tickets on our website and they will only be emailed to you once (it can end up in your SPAM).
     <br>
     The payment of your purchase is handled by an external payment service provider: Buckaroo. For more information on how Buckaroo handles your personal data, see the privacy statement here: www.buckaroo.nl/privacy statement.
     <br>
     2.2.3 Vue Movie Pass
     <br>
     To purchase a Vue Movie Pass subscription you need a MyVue account. The Vue Movie Pass is always personal. When applying for the pass, we therefore ask you for some identifying information. This data is used to put the digital pass in your MyVue account.
     <br>
     You must be at least 18 years old to subscribe to the Vue Movie Pass. If you are younger than 18, we will ask whether your parents/guardian have agreed to take out the subscription. Customer service and payments are made by a third party.
     <br>
     After termination of a subscription, your data will be kept for as long as is necessary for our work.
     <br>
     2.2.4 MyVue Account
     <br>
     You can create a personal MyVue account to buy an e-ticket or because you want to apply for a Vue Movie Pass. You must be at least 16 years old for a My Vue Account. If you are younger than 16, we will ask whether your parents/guardian have agreed to create an account. In your account you can view your watchlist, your ticket history and tickets for future films. You can also save different preferences for the newsletter. If you create an account via your Facebook account, Vue will have access to your public Facebook data as you have set it yourself on Facebook. Think of your name, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, profile picture and your Facebook ID. Vue has no influence on the data collection by Facebook. We therefore recommend that you read Facebook's privacy statement before using this option. We keep your account information as long as you have a Vue account. You can change or delete data in your account at any time. This can be done by logging into your MyVue account. Under your profile you can download a report of the personal data we have about you. You can also send a request to have your account deleted. This removal request will be processed within 30 days. Sometimes we will still need to keep some data in connection with (legal) obligations, such as accounting retention obligations that Vue has. This can be done by logging into your MyVue account. Under your profile you can download a report of the personal data we have about you. You can also send a request to have your account deleted. This removal request will be processed within 30 days.

     <br>
     If you contact us because you have something to say, a question or a complaint, it will go to Vue Customer Service.
