# VUE-X loyalty program 

## Description of the project

DESEND goal is to keep the customers interested and willing to come back to the
cinema theatre more often. Partnering with a food chain for instance: like Starbucks
(Win a free Starbucks drink and share a picture of it) would make the company more
broad and interesting. Also to our customers a pleasant experience by making the
loyalty platform easy to comprehend and give a feeling of trust, so that the brand
character can bond with the individual customer. (and make it long term)
As the team know the gains and pains of VUE cinema, what and where the media
agency have to focus to make the customer, who often goes there, feel special and to
create a community that they can feel themselves and to do fun challenges with which
they will win prizes. Moreover, what the students can do to make VUE better cinema
and to become better than the competitors..
## Description of the project

**Double Diamond**

The double diamond is helpful at the begging when the team have to have to do
brainstorm, research, design, prototyping and testing. It represents our design
process.

**Agile**

DESEND chose to work with Agile because the team believe that this is the most
efficient way to do our job. Because it is not a waterfall and the students can find easily
if there is a problem in the way of how DESEND are working through the feedback that
is receiving from our teachers, formal client and users as well. Also, every sprint the
team sit and discuss what we have to do and give deadlines in this way we will be on
track and if something pop-ups we to be ready to react quickly. Moreover, the
students are trying to be flexible, because the students have to be ready for everything
and to manage at the end to show the best that the team can do.
